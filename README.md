## ✅ Completed Projects

### 1. [Diwali Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Shivam-DataAnalytics/Exploratory-Data_Analysis/tree/main/1_Diwali_sales_analysis)
A comprehensive EDA project based on Diwali sales data. The analysis highlights:

- Top purchasing demographics by age, gender, marital status
- High-performing states and occupations by sales
- Product categories driving revenue
- In-depth charts and visual summaries

📌 **Key Insight**: Married women aged 26–35, mainly from UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka working in IT and Healthcare, are the primary buyers—especially of food, clothing, and electronics.

### 2. [Medical Appointment No-Show Analysis](https://github.com/Shivam-DataAnalytics/Exploratory-Data_Analysis/tree/main/2_Medical_data)
An analytical dive into over 110,000 medical appointments in Brazil, focused on understanding why patients miss scheduled visits.

- Investigates roles of age, gender, health conditions, and SMS reminders
- Analyzes gap between scheduling and actual appointments
- Visual breakdown by neighborhood, conditions, and socio-economic factors

**📌 Key Insight**: Young patients (<30) tend to miss appointments more, especially when there’s a long gap between scheduling and the appointment. SMS reminders help marginally.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

### 🐍 Python  
The main programming language used for scripting and performing data analysis due to its simplicity and strong data ecosystem.

### 🧮 Pandas  
Used for data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. Enables powerful operations like groupby, filtering, and statistical summaries.

### 🔢 NumPy  
Supports high-performance numerical computations and array operations, especially useful for handling numerical data efficiently.

### 📊 Matplotlib  
A foundational plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations like bar graphs and line charts.

### 🌈 Seaborn  
Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides aesthetically pleasing statistical plots such as count plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

### 🧠 Jupyter Notebook  
An interactive environment that allows mixing code, visualizations, and narrative text—perfect for EDA reporting and documentation.
